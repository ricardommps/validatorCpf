https://cogoport.github.io/cogo-toast/

## Get Started

Install via NPM:

```
npm install --save cogo-toast
```

Install via Yarn:

```
yarn add cogo-toast
```

## Usage

Its Plug and Play. No configuration required. Just import and you are good to go.

```javascript
import cogoToast from 'cogo-toast';

cogoToast.success("This is a success message!");
```

### 5 Built in Types

There are 5 built-in types to handle the most common cases in any application. 

```javascript
cogoToast.success('This is a success message');

cogoToast.info('This is a info message');

cogoToast.loading('This is a loading message');

cogoToast.warn('This is a warn message');

cogoToast.error('This is a error message');
```

### Returns a Promise

Returns a promise which resolves when the toast is about to hide. 

This can be useful to do some action when the toast has completed showing.

```javascript
cogoToast.loading("Loading your data...").then(()=>{
  cogoToast.success("Data Successfully Loaded");
});
```

When hideAfter = 0, It returns a callback function that hides the toast, instead of a promise.

### Completely Customizable

The second parameter to the function is an options object that can be passed in for customization.

```javascript
cogoToast.info("This is an info message", options);
```

#### All Available Options

Here's a list of all the available options, to customize the toast to your needs.
